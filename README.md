Check Mail Addon

Python script to check multiple email accounts for new messages. Its main goal is to notify Kodi clients about incoming messages. In addition, you can configure automatic saving of attachments sent from known email addresses.

The script supports basic authentication with username and password as well as the OAuth2 method (currently only for Google and Microsoft). It uses Python's Imaplib in combination with a self-developed Idle method to fetch email messages.
